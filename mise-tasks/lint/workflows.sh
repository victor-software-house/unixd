# GitHub runs only the repository root's workflows, so the task lints those
# from the root, also in a render below it, such as cli/.
#
# actionlint fails on a workflow folder with no file (actionlint 1.7.12,
# linter.go LintDir). The task therefore lints the tracked workflows only.
# With none, as in a fresh Bun render, nothing runs and the check passes.
#
# :(glob) keeps * in .github/workflows itself, the files GitHub runs. A failing
# git ls-files fails the task. -z hands xargs each path unquoted, whatever it
# holds.
