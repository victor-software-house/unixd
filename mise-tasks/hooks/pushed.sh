# pre-push runs this with git's pre-push lines on stdin, one
# `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>` per ref. raw connects
# that stdin to the task.
#
# No linter reads those lines itself. committed and cocogitto take one
# revision range, and gitleaks takes git log options. This loop turns the
# lines into commits and hands them to the commits and hooks:secrets:history
# tasks, whose stdin is closed.
#
# A delete (all-zero local sha) pushes nothing.
#
# The loop excludes every commit a remote-tracking ref already holds. That
# skips the default branch's history, GitHub squash merges included, and
# commits pushed before. It works on a push to a URL or to a remote with no
# tracking refs yet, too. The remote sha covers a remote tip that no tracking
# ref names.
